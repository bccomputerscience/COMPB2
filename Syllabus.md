## Digital Devices (Cell phones, Personal Computer Devices)
Cell phones and cell phone usage is a classroom disruption. You know how to use and operate your devices. It is expected that you will turn cells phones off or otherwise silence your devices before class starts and respond only after class ends. If class has not started, please do not
have conversations within class on your device. Carry your conversation outside of the classroom. If there is an an emergency, you should leave the class to answer your calls or messages. Do not send text messages while in class. Again, have your conversations outside of class. This includes any
other social media platform that has messaging capabilities. Do not conduct personal conversations when the instructor is lecturing. Disciplinary action including removal from class will result. Personal computers or other electronic devices should not be used in class for non-class related activities. In classes with Labs or other areas where computers are being used, these systems are provided for classroom activities only. 

## Attendance
Attendance is mandatory. The attendance policy as outlined in the campus catalog will be enforced. Students must notify me in
the event of class absences.  Any student that is absent for more than two weeks without prior instructor notification may be 
dropped from the course. If you do not want to be in the class then you must drop yourself from the course.  I will not 
retroactively drop you if you miss one of the “last day” to drop the course dates.  These dates are listed in class schedule 
and in the online campus schedule “Important Dates” section. It is also expected that students will notify me before class in 
the rare instance of needing to leave class early.  Students, not notifying me in advance, will be marked absent upon their early 
departure.

## General Classroom Etiquette
The intent of the classroom etiquette policy is to outline the need to have considerations for other students within your class. The following guidelines
have been provided to help you understand what this means.

* Digital devices should be silenced, turned off, or otherwise muted. 
* Prepare your desktop/tabletop area before the lecture starts. Prepare to leave once the lecture is concluded. Not before.
  * If you're in a computer lab, get logged in promptly. 
* No eating in the classroom.
  * If you're in a computer lab, do not bring in outside beverages.
* Sleeping is now allowed. If you are tired, please rest outside of the classroom. If you'd like, you can stand up in the back of the class.
  * If you are asleep you will be asked to leave.
